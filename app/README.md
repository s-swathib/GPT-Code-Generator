streamlit run main.py
```
3. Go to https://{Your-AMLCompute-Name}-{port}.{your-region}.instances.azureml.ms/ to test  
Example: https://myComputeInstance-8501.southcentralus.instances.azureml.ms/ 
 
## To Deploy in Azure Web App Service

[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fpablomarin%2FGPT-Azure-Search-Engine%2Fmain%2Fapp%2Fazuredeploy.json)

1. Make Sure that once the ARM template is ready to be created in the Azure portal, you change the ***Repo Url*** variable to your own repo:
"https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>/GPT-Azure-Search-Engine.git"

2. Everytime you commit changes to your branch it will kick in CI/CD and deploy your changes to the web app

## Troubleshoot

- If WebApp deployed succesfully but the Application didn't start
1. Go to Azure portal -> Your Webapp -> Settings -> Configuration -> General Settings
2. Make sure that StartUp Command has:  python -m streamlit run app/main.py --server.port 8000 --server.address 0.0.0.0

- If deployment fails with error "Cannot find SourceControlToken with name Github" you can try the following
1. Wait 20 mins and Retry
2. Delete the browser cache and retry
3. Go to the deployed WebApp and Authorize azure to deploy and build code directly from Github 

![Authorize Github](../images/error-authorize-github.jpeg "Authorize Github" )

- If running locally fails with error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'type' and '_GenericAlias'"
In AML Compute Instance terminal check your list of conda environments and activate one with Python 3.10 or higher
